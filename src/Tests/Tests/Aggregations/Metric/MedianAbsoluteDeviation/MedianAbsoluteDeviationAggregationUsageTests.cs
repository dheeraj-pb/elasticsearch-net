	/**
	 * A single-value aggregation that approximates the median absolute deviation of its search results.
	 *
	 * Median absolute deviation is a measure of variability. It is a robust statistic, meaning that it is
	 * useful for describing data that may have outliers, or may not be normally distributed.
	 * For such data it can be more descriptive than standard deviation.
	 *
	 * It is calculated as the median of each data point's deviation from the median of the
	 * entire sample. That is, for a random variable `X`, the median absolute deviation is `median(|median(X) - Xi|)`.
